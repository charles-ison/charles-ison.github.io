Hi! My name is Charles Ison and I'm a second year computer science PhD student at Oregon State University. I am currently co-advised by Professor [Yue Zhang](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangyue/) and  Professor [Eugene Zhang](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhange/).

Prior to graduate school, I worked for three years as a SDE and SDE II for Amazon.

I completed my undergraduate education at Clemson University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematical Sciences.

Outside of school I am the Treasurer for the OSU Cycling Club and enjoy mountain bike racing. I also have a passion for music production and it initially sparked my interest in coding.

Worked on project with the Oregon Department of Transportation to explore using computer vision models for detecting and counting wildlife from camera trap data. Model performance surpassed currently published state-of-the-art for camera trap wildlife counting. Ideally our results will help drive more informed infrastructure decisions. More details and paper coming soon.
